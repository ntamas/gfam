Archival notice
===============

``gfam`` is now archived and has been superseded by `ConSAT`_. If you are new
to ``gfam``, please consider using `ConSAT`_ instead.

The original documentation of ``gfam`` follows from here for historical
purposes.

Introduction
============

This is the documentation of ``gfam``, a Python module to aid the automatic
annotation of gene families based on consensus domain architecture. ``gfam``
started out as a collection of loosely coupled Python scripts that process the
output of ``iprscan`` (a tool to obtain domain assignments of individual genes
from InterPro) and conduct some analyses using BLAST to detect novel,
previously uncharacterised domains. The original domains and the detected novel
domain candidates are then used to create a consensus domain assignment for
each gene sequence. Genes are then finally assigned to families based on their
domain architectures, and a Gene Ontology overrepresentation analysis is
conducted on the GO annotations of individual domains in the same sequence to
come up with a set of functional labels for each sequence.

Requirements
============

You will need the following tools to run ``gfam``:

* `Python 2.5`_ or later. Python 3 is not supported yet. ``gfam`` also
  seems to work with `Jython`, but this was not tested thoroughly.

* `NCBI BLAST`_; in particular, the ``formatdb`` and ``blastall`` tools
  from the legacy C-based BLAST distribution.

.. _`Python 2.5`: http://www.python.org
.. _`NCBI BLAST`: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/LATEST
.. _Jython: http://www.jython.org

The latest release of `SciPy`_ is recommended, but not necessary.
``gfam`` uses `SciPy`_ for calculating the logarithm of the gamma
function in the overrepresentation analysis routines, but it falls
back to a (somewhat slower) Python implementation if `SciPy`_ is
not installed.

Running ``gfam``
================

``gfam`` is driven by a master configuration file named ``gfam.cfg``.
A sample configuration file is given in the distribution. The sample
file works fine for the gene sequences of *Arabidopsis thaliana*; for
other species, you might have to tweak some of the parameters, and you
will surely have to modify the paths to the data files. The configuration
file is documented and mostly self-explanatory.

You can launch ``gfam`` by typing::

    $ bin/gfam

This will run the whole ``gfam`` analysis pipeline using the configuration
specified in ``gfam.cfg``. If your configuration file is named otherwise,
you can run it by typing::

    $ bin/gfam -c my_config.cfg
